; 
; PROBLEM:
; 
; You might want to create boxes of different colours.
; 
; Use the How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe to design a function that consumes a colour, and creates
; a solid 10x10 box of that colour.
; 
; Your complete design should include signature, purpose, commented out stub, examples/tests, 
; commented out template and the completed function definition.
