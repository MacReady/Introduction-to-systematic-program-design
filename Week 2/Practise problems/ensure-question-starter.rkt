; PROBLEM:
; 
; Use the How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe to design a function that consumes a string, and adds "?" 
; to the end unless the string already ends in "?".
; 
; For this question, assume string is a word, so it has length > 0. Your complete design should include 
; signature, purpose, commented out stub, examples/tests, commented out template and the completed function 
; definition.
