;; Data definitions:

; 
; PROBLEM A:
; 
; You are working on a system that will automate delivery for 
; YesItCanFly! airlines catering service. 
; There are two dinner options for each passenger, chicken or pasta. 
; They can also choose not to order a meal, 
; which the system records as false. 
; Design a data definition to represent a dinner order. 
; Call the type DinnerOrder.
; 


;; =================
;; Functions:

; 
; PROBLEM B:
; 
; Design the function dinner-order-to-msg that consumes a dinner order 
; and produces a message for the flight attendants saying
; what the passenger ordered. 
; For example, calling dinner-order-to-msg for a chicken dinner 
; would produce "The passenger ordered chicken."
